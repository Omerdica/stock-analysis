Overview
    Steve provided me with an Excel files containing information on 12 different stocks. He was asked by his parents to help him choose what would be best investment for them and what returns they would see over the last 2 years. 
Results
After creating DqAnalysis we realised that Steves parents would not benefit from investing in this stock. We decided it was best to run data on all stocks. We had to create a new macros that would help us provide more indepth information for Steve. The first VBA code we made was to break down the total volume for each companie and their annual return.

The second refactored code was put in to see if we can increase the speed that we get the results in.
