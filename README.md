### Overview
## Steve provided me with an Excel files containing information on 12 different stocks. He was asked by his parents to help him choose what would be best investment for them and what returns they would see based on the data provided from the last 2 years.

### Results
## After creating DqAnalysis, we realised that Steve's parents would not benefit from investing in this specific stock. We determined it would be best to run data on all stocks. We had to create a new macro that would help us provide more in-depth information for Steve. The first VBA code we made was to break down the total volume for each company and their annual return.

## The refracotred code was created to see if a different approach would provide more specific information for Steve. By doing this, we were able to increase the speed of the code and also clean up the data. We started by adding indexVolumes and creating new For loops.
